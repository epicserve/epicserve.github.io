I didn't technically learn all of this today, but I've slowly been learning new things about UV almost daily. Here are
some of the awesome things `uv tool` can do:

1. With `uv tool run`, you can run commands to test things without the need to install them. Example,
   `uv tool run pycowsay "hi"`. This will run the `pycowsay` command with the argument `hi`. I was curious if the python
   package was cached and if so, how it was cached. So I asked, and
   [@charliermarsh](https://x.com/charliermarsh/status/1850896707946475839) said the package is cached and
   updated frequently.
2. Is `uv tool run pycowsay "hi"` too long to type? UV has you covered with the `uvx` alias, you can use
   `uvx pycowsay "hi"` instead.
3. Do you have a tool you use all the time and want it installed in its own isolated environment? You can use
   `uv tool install` to install it. Example, `uv tool install ruff`. Curious where it was installed to? You can use
   `uv tool dir` to find out.
4. Want to upgrade a tool or all tools? You can use `uv tool upgrade ruff` to upgrade the `ruff` tool or
   `uv tool upgrade --all` to upgrade all tools.
